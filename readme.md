This is mainly as a reference for useful gems that can be used on [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and non-ruby projects.  
Most of these gems are related to [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org)

I have to give a huge props to [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb/) of [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/). Sign-up for the pro version, it is well worth the money!
